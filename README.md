## `HitCounter` component

The `HitCounter` component is using Firestore for syncing visitor keys in real-time.
It calls the `register-hit` Netlify function, which increments/sets registered hits.
For this component to work, you need to set up 2 sets of environment variables one for
the `HitCounter` and another is for the `register-hits`.

Create 2 env files for `HitCounter`:

1. `.env.production`
2. `.env.development`

Paste these variables in both of the files:

```
FIREBASE_API_KEY=BISfSyD32C3OSD31rF4V1FHdX_XEo6v5FaDHSEi
FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=example.firebaseapp.com
FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL=https://example.firebaseio.com
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=example
FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=example.appspot.com
```

For `registered-hits` function:

    - open [Netlify admin panel](https://app.netlify.com/)
    - site overview
    - site settings
    - build and deploy
    - environment
    - click the "Edit" button

Copy and paste all production variables from `.env.production`. Copy and paste all
development variables from `.env.development` and add `DEV` suffix to each one of
them, e.g. `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID_DEV`.

Add security configurations (it's required because your API keys are stored on the client):

    - go to [Google developer console](https://console.developers.google.com/apis)
    - select your Firebase project
    - click on the "Credentials" tab
    - from the "API keys" list click on the "Browser key"
    - click on the "Application restrictions" tab
    - select "HTTP referrers (web sites)" option
    - in the "Accept requests from these HTTP referrers" section enter your production site address in `*.example.com/*` format
    - in the "API restrictions" sections choose the "Restrict key" option
    - select "Cloud Firestore API"  for the list
